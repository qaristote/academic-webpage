I am a student at the [Computer Science Department (DI)](https://www.di.ens.fr/) of the [École Normale Supérieure de Paris](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en), an institution part of [PSL University](https://www.psl.eu/en). 

I am mainly interested in category theory and functional programming, but I also enjoy broadening my knowledge in other diverse topics.

I am currently following postgraduate courses in Mathematics before finishing my Master's degree in Theoretical Computer Science.
