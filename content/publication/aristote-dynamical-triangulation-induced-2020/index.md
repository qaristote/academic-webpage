abstract: We present the single-particle sector of a quantum cellular automaton, namely
  a quantum walk, on a simple dynamical triangulated 2-manifold. The triangulation
  is changed through Pachner moves, induced by the walker density itself, allowing
  the surface to transform into any topologically equivalent one. This model extends
  the quantum walk over triangular grid, introduced in a previous work, by one of
  the authors, whose space-time limit recovers the Dirac equation in (2+1)-dimensions.
  Numerical simulations show that the number of triangles and the local curvature
  grow as exp(a log(t) - bt²), where a and b parametrize the way geometry changes
  upon the local density of the walker, and that, in the long run, flatness emerges.
  Finally, we also prove that the global behavior of the walker, remains the same
  under spacetime random fluctuations.
